    <p> My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time.Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing me home work. I am 11 years old and read in class 6th.Now I know very well that reading is good habit which can make me complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally.Readind books keep one always happy and busy.It is the good source of enjoyment,knowledge,inspiration and instructions.It makes us disciplined,loyal,puctual and most importantly a successfull person in the life.
